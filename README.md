## Kidney_Disease_OneAPI
A chronic kidney disease prediction using Random Forest Algorithm using Intel's One API Toolkit. This project was a demo implementation or an experiment of Random Forest Algorithm, how the code works in Google Colab and using Intel One API, what is the difference between using these platforms. 
Our final output was implementing my project in Intel's One API Platform using Intel's DAL and we had achieved an accuracy of 88%.
